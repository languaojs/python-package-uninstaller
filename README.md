# Python Package Uninstaller
This is a simple python package uninstaller with Streamlit-based GUI. DWYOR!

This simple app uses Streamlit for its UI and the code is actually created using ChatGPT.
This app is made to help me removing some no-longer-used python packages. Since I do not remember all the packages' names, I make this app with the help of ChatGPT.
In order to use this app, you need to install Streamlit.

<code>pip install streamlit</code>

Then, to use this app, locate the app.py and run it through terminal:

<code>streamlit run app.py --server.port 8080</code>

I need to set the server port, you may not need it.

# WARNING

Uninstalling particular packages may give you unnecessary frustration. So, please do it with your own risk!
